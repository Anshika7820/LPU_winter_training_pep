/*

    A Graph G=(V,E) consist of:
    V -> set of vertices(nodes) -> An individual object of graph
    E -> set of edges connecting pairs of vertices 

    -Directed graph -> edges have direction
    -Undirected graph -> edges have no direction
    -Weighted -> edges have values (weight/ cost/ distance)
    -Unweighted -> edges have no values

    Path -> a sequence of vertices connected by edges

    Cycle -> a path that start and end at the same vertex.

    Dergree : in undirectr=ed graph - number of edges connected to a vertex
              in directed graph - indegree and outdegree
              in degree: number of edges coming into a vertex
              out degree: number of edges going out of a vertex
