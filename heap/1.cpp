/*
 Heap -> a heap i a complete binary tree that follows the heap order property
      - Complete Binary Tree (CBT) -> all levels are completely filled except the last level, the last level is filled from left to right
      - Heap order property -> 1. Max Heap -> Every parent node is greater than or equal to its children (the largest element is always at root).
                            -> 2. Min Heap -> Every parent node is smaller than or equal to its children (the smallest element is always at top).

        ** important -> heap is not BST
